I'm a PhD student in machine learning at the division of Robotics, perception & learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm since August 2017. My advisor is [Prof. Hedvig Kjellström](http://csc.kth.se/~hedvig).

My research project revolves around trying to detect horses' pain expressions using computer vision. I work mostly with video data and have found that the temporal unfolding of these videos is decisive for reliable pain diagnostics; hence I'm interested in spatiotemporal features and action recognition. Currently I'm looking into the interpretability of deep action recognition models.  


#### Why recognize pain in horses?

Learning to detect pain in horses automatically is important because it is difficult for humans, even for veterinarian experts in equine pain. Horses are prey animals and tend to hide their pain, not wanting to show when they are vulnerable. Currently, many horses in Sweden are euthanized prematurely due to disorders which are not really lethal, such as problems with joints, because we detect the conditions too late for treatment.   


#### Student representation

I'm member of the PhD Chapter board, representing KTH doctoral students centrally, and vice-chair of the PhD student council of the EECS school.



#### Background

Before I started my PhD, I was in the engineering physics program at KTH, with my MSc in machine learning. My BSc thesis from 2014 was on the use of partial differential equations in climate modeling. Even longer ago I lived for two years in Paris, waitressed, and read David Foster Wallace books that made me want to not _not_ study maths.
