I'm a PhD student at the Robotics, perception & learning lab (RPL) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm since August 2017. My advisor is [Prof. Hedvig Kjellström](http://csc.kth.se/~hedvig).

My research project revolves around trying to detect horses' pain expressions using computer vision. I work mostly with video data and have found that the temporal unfolding of these videos is decisive for reliable pain diagnostics; hence I'm interested in spatiotemporal features and action recognition. Currently I'm looking into the interpretability of deep action recognition models.
