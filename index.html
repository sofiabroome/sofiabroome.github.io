        <p>I have (as of Sept 2 2022) a Ph.D. in machine learning from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, at the Robotics, Perception & Learning (RPL) division. My advisor has been <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/hedvig">Prof. Hedvig Kjellstr√∂m</a>. I was also co-advised by <a href="https://www.slu.se/cv/pia-haubro/"> Prof. Pia Haubro Andersen</a>. My thesis, with title <b>Learning Spatiotemporal Features in Low-Data and Fine-Grained Action Recognition with an Application to Equine Pain Behavior</b> can be found <a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1670034&dswid=-9463">here</a>.</p>


        <p>My research project has revolved around trying to detect horses' pain expressions using computer vision. I've worked mostly with video data and have found that the temporal unfolding of these videos is decisive for reliable pain diagnostics; hence I'm interested in spatiotemporal features and action recognition as well.</p>

        
        <h3>Why recognize pain in horses?</h3>

        <p>Learning to detect pain in horses automatically is important because it is difficult for humans, even for veterinarian experts in equine pain. Horses are prey animals and tend to hide their pain, not wanting to show when they are vulnerable. Currently, many horses in Sweden are euthanized prematurely due to disorders which are not really lethal, such as problems with joints, because we detect the conditions too late for treatment.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Background</b>
        <br>

        Before I started my Ph.D., I was in the engineering physics program at KTH, with my MSc in machine learning. My BSc thesis from 2014 was on the use of partial differential equations in climate modeling. Even longer ago I lived for two years in Paris, waitressed, and read David Foster Wallace books that made me want to not <i>not</i> study maths.

         <br>
         <br> 
        <b>Reviewing</b>
<br>
        I was a reviewer for ECCV2020, CVPR2021, ICCV2021, WACV2022, ICLR2022, CVPR2022, NeurIPS 2022 and WACV2023. Assistant reviewer for RSS2020.

                    <em>Abstract:</em> Advances in animal motion tracking and pose recognition have been a game changer in the study of animal behavior. Recently, an increasing number of works go ‚Äòdeeper‚Äô than tracking, and address automated recognition of animals‚Äô internal states such as emotions and pain with the aim of improving animal welfare, making this a timely moment for a systematization of the field. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of computer vision-based research on recognition of pain and emotional states in animals, addressing both facial and bodily behavior analysis. We summarize the efforts that have been presented so far within this topic‚Äîclassifying them across different dimensions, highlight challenges and research gaps, and provide best practice recommendations for advancing the field, and some future directions for research.

                    <b>Recur, Attend or Convolve? On Whether Temporal Modeling Matters for Cross-Domain Robustness in Action Recognition</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    <em>Abstract:</em> Most action recognition models today are highly parameterized, and evaluated on datasets with appearance-wise distinct classes. It has also been shown that 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) tend to be biased toward texture rather than shape in still image recognition tasks, in contrast to humans. Taken together, this raises suspicion that large video models partly learn spurious spatial texture correlations rather than to track relevant shapes over time to infer generalizable semantics from their movement. A natural way to avoid parameter explosion when learning visual patterns over time is to make use of recurrence. Biological vision consists of abundant recurrent circuitry, and is superior to computer vision in terms of domain shift generalization. In this article, we empirically study whether the choice of low-level temporal modeling has consequences for texture bias and cross-domain robustness. In order to enable a light-weight and systematic assessment of the ability to capture temporal structure, not revealed from single frames, we provide the Temporal Shape (TS) dataset, as well as modified domains of Diving48 allowing for the investigation of spatial texture bias in video models. The combined results of our experiments indicate that sound physical inductive bias such as recurrence in temporal modeling may be advantageous when robustness to domain shift is important for the task.

                  <b>Sharing Pain: Using Pain Domain Transfer for Video Recognition of Low Grade Orthopedic Pain in Horse</b>
                  <p>
                  <br>
                  <em>Abstract:</em> Orthopedic disorders are common among horses, often leading to euthanasia, which often could have been avoided with earlier detection. These conditions often create varying degrees of subtle long-term pain. It is challenging to train a visual pain recognition method with video data depicting such pain, since the resulting pain behavior also is subtle, sparsely appearing, and varying, making it challenging for even an expert human labeller to provide accurate ground-truth for the data. We show that a model trained solely on a dataset of horses with acute experimental pain (where labeling is less ambiguous) can aid recognition of the more subtle displays of orthopedic pain. Moreover, we present a human expert baseline for the problem, as well as an extensive empirical study of various domain transfer methods and of what is detected by the pain recognition method trained on clean experimental pain in the orthopedic dataset. Finally, this is accompanied with a discussion around the challenges posed by real-world animal behavior datasets and how best practices can be established for similar fine-grained action recognition tasks.

                  <b>Equine Pain Behavior Classification via Self-Supervised Disentangled Pose Representation</b>
                  <p>
                  <br>
                  <em>Abstract:</em> Timely detection of horse pain is important for equine welfare. Horses express pain through their facial and body behavior, but may hide signs of pain from unfamiliar human observers. In addition, collecting visual data with detailed annotation of horse behavior and pain state is both cumbersome and not scalable. Consequently, a pragmatic equine pain classification system would use video of the unobserved horse and weak labels. This paper proposes such a method for equine pain classification by using multi-view surveillance video footage of unobserved horses with induced orthopaedic pain, with temporally sparse video level pain labels. To ensure that pain is learned from horse body language alone, we first train a self-supervised generative model to disentangle horse pose from its appearance and background before using the disentangled horse pose latent representation for pain classification. To make best use of the pain labels, we develop a novel loss that formulates pain classification as a multi-instance learning problem. Our method achieves pain classification accuracy better than human expert performance with 60% accuracy. The learned latent horse pose representation is shown to be viewpoint covariant, and disentangled from horse appearance. Qualitative analysis of pain classified segments shows correspondence between the pain symptoms identified by our model, and equine pain scales used in veterinary practice.

                  <p>
                  <br>
                  <em>Abstract:</em> In this paper we present our preliminary work on model-based behavioral analysis of horse motion. Our approach is based on the SMAL model, a 3D articulated statistical model of animal shape. We define a novel SMAL model for horses based on a new template, skeleton and shape space learned from 37 horse toys. We test the accuracy of our hSMAL model in reconstructing a horse from 3D mocap data and images. We apply the hSMAL model to the problem of lameness detection from video, where we fit the model to images to recover 3D pose and train an ST-GCN network on pose data. A comparison with the same network trained on mocap points illustrates the benefit of our approach.

                    <em>Abstract:</em>
                    A number of techniques for interpretability have been presented for deep learning in computer vision, typically with the goal of understanding what the networks have based their classification on. However, interpretability for deep video architectures is still in its infancy and we do not yet have a clear concept of how to decode spatiotemporal features. In this paper, we present a study comparing how 3D convolutional networks and convolutional LSTM networks learn features across temporally dependent frames. This is the first comparison of two video models that both convolve to learn spatial features but have principally different methods of modeling time. Additionally, we extend the concept of meaningful perturbation introduced by Fong & Vedaldi (ICCV 2017) to the temporal dimension, to identify the temporal part of a sequence most meaningful to the network for a classification decision. Our findings indicate that the 3D convolutional model concentrates on shorter events in the input sequence, and places its spatial focus on fewer, contiguous areas.

                  <b>Dynamics are Important for the Recognition of Equine Pain in Video</b>
                  <p>
                  <br>
                  <em>Abstract:</em>  A prerequisite to successfully alleviate pain in animals is to recognize it, which is a great challenge in non-verbal species. Furthermore, prey animals such as horses tend to hide their pain. In this study, we propose a deep recurrent two-stream architecture for the task of distinguishing pain from non-pain in videos of horses. Different models are evaluated on a unique dataset showing horses under controlled trials with moderate pain induction, which has been presented in earlier work. Sequential models are experimentally compared to single-frame models, showing the importance of the temporal dimension of the data, and are benchmarked against a veterinary expert classification of the data. We additionally perform baseline comparisons with generalized versions of state-of-the-art human pain recognition methods. While equine pain detection in machine learning is a novel field, our results surpass veterinary expert performance and outperform pain detection results reported for other larger non-human species.

                  <em>Abstract:</em> The recently developed Equine Facial Action Coding System (EquiFACS) provides a precise and exhaustive, but laborious, manual labelling method of facial action units of the horse. To automate parts of this process, we propose a Deep Learning-based method to detect EquiFACS units automatically from images. We use a cascade framework; we firstly train several object detectors to detect the predefined Region-of-Interest (ROI), and secondly apply binary classifiers for each action unit in related regions. We experiment with both regular CNNs and a more tailored model transferred from human facial action unit recognition. Promising initial results are presented for nine action units in the eye and lower face regions. Code for the project is publicly available.
